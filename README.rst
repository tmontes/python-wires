``wires`` is a library to facilitate "callable wiring" by decoupling callers from callees and avoiding passing around multiple callables in Python code; it can be used as a callable-based event system or, again callable-based, publish-subscribe like solution.

Minimal usage example:

.. code-block:: python

    from wires import wiring, wire

    def my_callable():
        print('Hello from wires!')

    wire.this_callable.calls_to(my_callable)
    wiring.this_callable()
