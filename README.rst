Python Wires is a library to facilitate callable wiring by decoupling callers from callees. It can be used as a simple callable-based event notification system, as an in-process publish-subscribe like solution, or in any context where 1:N callable decoupling is appropriate.


Installation
------------

Python Wires is a pure Python package distributed via `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wires>`_. Install it with:

.. code-block:: console

	$ pip install wires



Quick Start
-----------

Create a ``Wiring`` object:

.. code-block:: python

    from wires import Wiring

    w = Wiring()

Its attributes are callables, auto-created on first access, that can be wired to other callables:


.. code-block:: python

    def say_hello():
        print('Hello from wires!')

    w.my_callable.wire(say_hello)       # Wires `w.my_callable`, auto-created, to `say_hello`.


Calling such callables calls their wired callables:

.. code-block:: python

    w.my_callable()                     # Prints 'Hello from wires!'


More wirings can be added:

.. code-block:: python

    def say_welcome():
        print('Welcome!')

    w.my_callable.wire(say_welcome)     # Wires `w.my_callable` to `say_welcome`, as well.
    w.my_callable()                     # Prints 'Hello from wires!' and 'Welcome!'.


Wirings can also be removed:

.. code-block:: python

    w.my_callable.unwire(say_hello)     # Removes the wiring to `say_hello`.
    w.my_callable()                     # Prints 'Welcome!'

    w.my_callable.unwire(say_welcome)   # Removes the wiring to `say_welcome`.
    w.my_callable()                     # Does nothing.
